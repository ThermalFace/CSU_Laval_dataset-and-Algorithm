# CSU_Laval_dataset-and-Algorithm

# Infrared face recognition model with CSU_Laval thermal infrared face dataset
This project contains an infrared face recognition model written on the Tensorflow2.x deep learning framework and a CSU_Laval thermal infrared face dataset constructed.

# Requirements
* Python3.7
* Tensorflow2.x
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* zipfile

# Details
* The section on attention mechanisms is defined in Attention.py
* The main structure of the model is defined in ModeCore.py
* The section on network learning training is defined in final_mode.py

* The link to access the CSU_Laval dataset is: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1wSBUBU8JBXyZa6wR4GC6Lg and the password is: ik65.
* The CSU_Laval dataset contains 344 individuals, with 210 at CSU and 134 at Laval University. For specific information on the dataset, please download the file and open the readme file.

# Usage
Download the dataset CSU_Laval dataset and open the project file *final_mode.py* to train the network model.  
Please see the paper for specific network parameter settings.
